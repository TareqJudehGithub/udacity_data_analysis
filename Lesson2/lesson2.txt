Design


There are two main reasons for creating visuals using data:

1. Exploratory Analysis
     - Exploratory analysis is done when you are searching for insights.
     - Exploratory Analysis is done behind the scene.
     - These visualizations don't need to be perfect.
     - You are using plots to find insights, but they don't need to be 
       aesthetically appealing.

2. Explanatory Analysis
     - Explanatory analysis is done when you are providing your results 
       for others. 
     - These visualizations need to provide you the emphasis necessary to 
       convey your message. 
     - Explanatory analysis should be accurate, insightful, and visually 
       appealing.

The five steps of the data analysis process:

     - Extract - Obtain the data from a spreadsheet, SQL, the web, etc.

     - Clean - Here we could use exploratory visuals.

     - Explore - Here we use exploratory visuals.

     - Analyze - Here we might use either exploratory or explanatory visuals.

     - Share - Here is where explanatory visuals live.

Visuals can be bad if they:

     - Don't convey the message.
     - Are misleading.

Chart junk 
     - Chart junk refers to all visual elements in charts and graphs that are 
       not necessary to comprehend the information represented on the graph or 
       that distract the viewer from this information.
     - Examples of chart junk:
          - Heavy or dark grid lines
          - Unnecessary text
          - Pictures surrounding or within graph
          - Shading or 3D components
          - Ornamented chart or axes

Data-ink ratio
     - Data-ink ration was defined in 1983 by Edward Tufte.
     - The ratio of amount of ink used to describe the data, to the total 
       amount of ink in the visual (describing everything else).
     - The higher the data-ink ratio is better.
     - Limiting chart junk increases the data-ink ratio.
     

Design Integrity 
 - It is key that when you build plots you maintain integrity for the 
   underlying data.
 - Lie Factor
     - Lie factor depicts the degree to which a visualization distorts or 
       misrepresents the data values being plotted.
     - Lie factor calculation formula:
       lie factor = (visual/visual start) / (data/data start)

 Important visual components like position, size, color, and length.
