Analyzing Quantitative Data

 There are four main aspects to analyzing Quantitative data:
  1. Measures of Center
      There are three measures of center:
      1. Mean
       The mean is often called the average or the expected value in mathematics.
       We calculate the mean by adding all of our values together, and dividing 
       by the number of values in our dataset.

      2. Median
       - The median splits our data so that 50% of our values are lower and 50% 
         are higher.
       - In order to compute the median we MUST sort our values first.
       - If we have an odd number of observations, the median is simply the 
         number in the direct middle.   (1, 2, 3) median is 2
       - If we have an even number of observations, the median is the average of 
         the two values in the middle.  (1, 2, 3, 4) median is (2 + 3)/2 

      3. Mode
        - The mode is the most frequently observed value in our dataset.
        - There might be multiple modes for a particular dataset, or no mode at 
        all.

          If we have the dataset:
          1, 2, 2, 3, 4
          The mode is 2 since it's the most frequent observed value.

        - No Mode
          If all observations in our dataset are observed with the same 
          frequency, there is no mode.

          If we have the dataset:
          1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4
          There is no mode, because all observations occur the same number of 
          times.
       - Many Mode
          If two (or more) numbers share the maximum value, then there is more 
          than one mode. 
          
          If we have the dataset:
          1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9
          The mode are numbers 3 and 6 (Many modes).
          



  2. Measures of Spread
  3. The Shape of the data.
  4. Outliers
