Measures of Spread

Measures of Spread are used to provide us an idea of how spread out our data are 
from one another. Common measures of spread include:

Range
Interquartile Range (IQR)
Standard Deviation
Variance

Histograms
Histograms are super useful to understanding the different aspects of 
quantitative data. In the upcoming concepts, you will see histograms used all 
the time to help you understand the four aspects we outlined earlier regarding 
a quantitative variable:
 center
 spread
 shape
 outliers
