Notations
 Notation is a common language used to communicate mathematical ideas.

Rows and Columns
- Spreadsheets are a common way to hold data. 
- A Column in a spreadsheet commonly holds a specific variable. 
- A row is commonly called an instance or individual.
- Random Variables

Random Variable
- A random variable is a placeholder for the possible values of some process. 
- X, Y, or Z are common ways to represent a random variable.
- n n pertains to the number of rows in our dataset

Capital vs Lower case Letters
 - Random variables are notated as capital letters. Example: X, Y
 - The outcome of these random variables (particular values) are 
   notated as lower case of the same letter, with a subscript that
   signifies the specific value of the random variable we are 
   considering. Example x = 5, y = 10
                         1      1
- x1, y2 is the notation for the first observed value of a random variable
- the amount of time someone spends on our site is a random variable (we are 
  not sure what the outcome will be for any particular visitor), and we would
  notate this with X. 
- Then when the first person visits the website, if they spend 5 minutes, we 
  have now observed this outcome of our random variable. We would notate any 
  outcome as a lowercase letter with a subscript associated with the order that 
  we observed the outcome. x = 5
                            1
  Example 1: 
   If 5 individuals visit our website, the first spends 10 minutes, the second 
   spends 20 minutes, the third spends 45 mins, the fourth spends 12 minutes, 
   and the fifth spends 8 minutes; we can notate this problem in the following 
   way:

     X is the amount of time an individual spends on our website.
     x  = ​ 10, x = 20, x = 45, x = 12, x = 8
      1         2       3       4       5 

 Example 2:
  What is the probability someone spends more than 20 minutes in our website?
     In notation, we would write:
      P(X > 20)?
     - Here P stands for probability, while the parentheses encompass the 
       statement for which we would like to find the probability. 
     -  Since X represents the amount of time spent on the website, this 
        notation represents the probability the amount of time on the website 
        is greater than 20.  
     - Studying the data from Example 1, only x is greater than 20
                                               3 
     P(X > 20) = x    1 out of 5     
                  3  
     P = (1/5) * 100 = 20% chance that an individual spends more than
     20 minutes on our website.

 Example 3
  If we asked: What is the probability of an individual spending 20 or more 
  minutes on our website?

  P(X >= 20)    x and x which is 2 out of 5
                 2     3
  P = (2/5 *) 100 = 40$ 


Aggregations 
 - Aggregation is way to turn multiple numbers into fewer numbers. Usually just 
 one number.
 - Summation is a common aggregation. The notation used to sum our values is a 
   greek symbol called sigma \SigmaΣ.
 E Sigma   
  Sigma symbolized Sum

 - If we wanted to multiply all of our values together we would use a product 
   sign II , capital Greek letter pi.  
 - The way we aggregate continuous values is with something known as integration,
   which uses the following symbol ∫ which is just a long s.
