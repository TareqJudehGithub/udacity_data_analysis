Data Types

1. Quantitative data (QD). QD Takes on numeric values that allow us to perform 
   mathematical operations (like the number of dogs).

2. Categorical Data (CD). QD are used to label a group or set of items (like 
   dog breeds - Bulldogs, Labs, Poodles, etc.).


 Quantitative Data types
     We can think of quantitative data as being either continuous or discrete.

     continuous vs. Discrete
     - Continuous data can be split into smaller and smaller units, and still a 
       smaller unit exists. Like age, we can measure the units of the age in 
       years, months, days, hours, seconds, but there are still smaller units 
       that could be associated with the age.

     - Discrete data only takes on countable values. The number of dogs we 
       interact with is an example of a discrete data type.
    
    - Continuous data types are those that can take on decimal values, where 
    discrete data types are those that are countable.

 Categorical Ordinal vs. Categorical Nominal
     We can divide categorical data further into two types: Ordinal and Nominal.

     1. Categorical Ordinal data take on a ranked ordering (like a ranked interaction 
     on a scale from Very Poor to Very Good with the dogs).

     2. Categorical Nominal data do not have an order or ranking (like the breeds 
     of the dog).
