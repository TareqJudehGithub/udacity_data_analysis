Data Visualization


- For quantitative data, if we are just looking at one column in your dataset, 
  this is called Univariate analysis. Where the Uni (unit) stands for one.
- Which plot should we use for Univariate?
     
     For Univariate quantitative data (both continuous and discrete), the 
     most common plot to visualize the data are: 
     1. Histogram. Histogram is the most common way to plot Univariate data.
     2. We could also use Box-And-Whisker plot.
     3. Stem-Leaf plot.
     4. Normal Quantile plot.

     For Univariate categorical data:
     1. Bar Chart. Is the most common way to plot data. A bar chart is like a
        histogram, but the bins are determined based on a set category and not
        based on a range that the chart creator can change. Bar charts are the
        favorite plot type for ordinal categorical data.
     2. Pie Chart.
     3. Pareto Chart. Pareto charts are essentially bar charts, where the bars
        order are from the most frequent to the least frequent.
     

     Scatter plots
      The scatter diagram graphs pairs of numerical data, with one variable on 
      each axis, to look for a relationship between them. If the variables are 
      correlated, the points will fall along a line or curve. The better the 
      correlation, the tighter the points will hug the line.
      
          - Scatter plots are best used for comparing two quantitative variables
            to one another (i.e price and sales, heights and weights).
          - Visualizes the strength and direction of the relationship of the two 
            variables.
          - Strong-Positive relationship. As variable Y increases, the other X 
          variable also increases.
          - Strong-Negative relationship. As variable Y increases, the other X 
            variable decreases.
          - As the points become more scattered from one another, this weakens 
            the relationship.
          - Strength are considered weak, moderate, or strong.
          - direction is considered positive or negative.
          - Correlation Coefficient. a numeric value to capture strength and 
            direction.
          - A correlation coefficient tells us the strength and direction of a 
            linear relationship.
          - The correlation coefficient is commonly donated by r.
          - The correlation coefficient is always between -1 and 1.
          - Closer the correlation coefficient to 1 and -1, the stronger the 
            relationship is.
          - The negative tells us that there is a negative relationship.
          - The positive tells us that there is a positive relationship.

        Correlation Coefficient
         - Correlation coefficients provide a measure of the strength and 
           direction of linear relationship.
         - We can tell the direction based on whether the correlation is 
           positive or negative.
         - A rule of thumb for judging the strength:
           - Strong   0.7 >= r <= 10
           - Moderate 0.3 >= r <= 0.7
           - Weak     0.0 >= 3 <= 0.3
