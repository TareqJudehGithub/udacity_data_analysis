Inferential Statistics
 Drawing Conclusions about a population based on data collected from a sample
 of individuals from that population.
 
 - Descriptive Statistics is about describing our collected data
 - Inferential Statistics is about using our collected data to draw Conclusions
   to a larger population.

 Let's say we wanted to analyse how many students (100,000 students) drink 
 coffee. We sent email about that study, but only 5000 students replied. We
 found out that only 73% of these students drink coffee.
 
   Population - our entire group of interest.          (100,000 students)       
   Sample - subset of the population                   (5000 students)     
   Statistic numeric summary about a sample            (73%)
   Parameter - numeric summary about a population      (Frequently we do not 
                                                       know this value, so we
                                                       must try and estimate)  


* Inference meaning: conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning.
