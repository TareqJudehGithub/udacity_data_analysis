The 5 steps of Data analysis process

 1. Ask questions
     Either you're given data and ask questions based on it, or you ask questions 
     first and gather data based on that later. great questions help you focus on 
     relevant parts of your data and direct your analysis towards meaningful insights.

 2. Wrangle Data
     Data wrangling is the process of gathering, selecting, and transforming 
     data to answer an analytical question.
     - You get the data you need in a form you can work with in three steps: 
       gather, assess, clean. 
     - Gather the data you need to answer your questions.
     - Assess your data to identify any problems in your data quality or 
       structure.
     - Clean your data by modifying, replacing, or removing data to ensure that 
       your dataset is of the highest quality and as well-structured as possible.

 3. Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
     You explore and then augment your data to maximize the potential of your 
     analyses, visualizations, and models.

 4.  Draw conclusions (or even make predictions)
     This step is typically approached with machine learning or inferential 
     statistics.

 5. Communicate your results
     There are many ways to communicate your results: reports, slide decks, 
     blog posts, emails, 
     presentations, or even conversations. Data visualization will always be 
     very valuable.
