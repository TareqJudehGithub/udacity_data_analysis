Measures of Spread

Measures of Spread are used to provide us an idea of how spread out our data  
from one another. Common measures of spread include:

1. Range
2. Interquartile Range (IQR)
3. Variance
4. Standard Deviation


5.Histograms

Histograms are super useful to understanding the different aspects of 
quantitative data. In the upcoming concepts, you will see histograms used all 
the time to help you understand the four aspects we outlined earlier regarding 
a quantitative variable:
 center
 spread
 shape
 outliers


5. The 5 Number Summary
 The 5 Number Summary is one of the most important ways to measures the spread
 of our data.
 Calculating the 5 Number Summary
The five number summary consist of 5 values:

1.   Minimum: The smallest number in the dataset.
2.   Q : The value such that 25% of the data fall below.  
      1
​
3.   Q : The value such that 50% of the data fall below (Also known as Median).
      2

4.   Q : The value such that 75% of the data fall below.
      3
​
5.   Maximum: The largest value in the dataset.

Range
 The range is then calculated as the difference between the maximum and the 
 minimum.

Interquartile Range (IQR) 
The interquartile range is calculated as the difference between Q and Q
