Outliers
 Outliers are data points that fall far from the rest of the dataset.
  
 Common Techniques
When outliers are present we should consider the following points.
 - Noting they exist and the impact on summary statistics.
 - If typo - remove or fix
 - Understanding why they exist, and the impact on questions we are 
   trying to answer about our data.
 - Reporting the 5 number summary values is often a better indication 
   than measures like the mean and standard deviation when we have outliers.
 -  Be careful in reporting. Know how to ask the right questions.
 
 Working with Outliers

 When analyzing data, here are some guidelines:
 1. Plot your data.
 2. Determine how to handle outliers if found.
 3. We can learn a lot with the mean and the standard deviation in normally
    distributed data.
 4. Reporting the 5 number summary values is often a better indication than 
    measures like the mean and standard deviation when we have outliers, or 
    when data is skewed.
 5. Be careful in reporting. Know how to ask the right questions.

. Identifying outliers and the shape associated with the distribution of our 
  data are easier when using a visual as opposed to using summary statistics.
