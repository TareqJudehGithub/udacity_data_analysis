Descriptive Statistics is a way to describe a collection of data.

Standard Deviation and Variance

     - We calculate the variance, by finding the average squared difference of 
       each observation (value) from the mean. The units of the variance are the 
       square of the original units of your data.
     - Then, we calculate the SD from variance square root.
     - SD will tell us on average, how much (how far) each point varies from the 
       mean of the points.
     - SD is defined as the average distance of each observation from the mean.
     - SD is used to compare the spread of different groups, to determine which
       is more spread out.
     - High SD is associated with higher risk.
     - All data comparison should be in the same unit.
     - Variance has squared units of the original dataset.
     - SD shares units with the original dataset, which makes it more useful
       measurement of spread.


     Example:
          Dataset = 10, 12, 14, 16
          
          1. Find the mean:
          10 + 12 + 14 + 16 = 52/4 = 13

          2. Subtract each value from the mean, and square the result.
          10 - 13 = -3 to the power of 2 = 9
          12 - 13 = -1 to the power of 2 = 1
          14 - 13 =  1 to the power of 2 = 1
          16 - 13 =  3 to the power of 2 = 9

          3. Calculate the Variance by dividing total of step 2 result by values
          numbers.
          Variance (9 + 1 + 1 + 9)/4 = 5

          4. Finally, calculate the Standard Deviation.
          The SD is the square root result of the variance.
          square root of 8 = 2.83
